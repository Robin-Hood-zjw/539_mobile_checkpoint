            <h4>Self-Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                I am <strong>JIAWEN ZHANG</strong>, and my English
                name is <strong>Robin</strong>. I was born in Wuxi
                City, Jiangsu Province, China, which is adjacent to
                Shanghai City. I stayed in China, the United Kingdom,
                and the United States for years. I am enjoying and
                cherishing my time in the USA right now.<br><br>

                My MBTI type is switching between <strong>ENTJ</strong>
                and <strong>INTJ</strong>, and I am a <strong>Scorpio</strong>.
                I believe such talking in some ways and such features
                in these theories fit my characteristics. I am a person
                who has clear targets and a strong push to gain to achieve.
                <br><br>

                I am exploring the opportunities of <strong>software
                engineer</strong>,<strong>data engineer</strong>,
                and <strong>data scientist</strong> in the United States.
                I am engaging in <strong>data manipulation</strong> and
                <strong>software engineering</strong>. I expect to
                explore the possibility of connecting cloud computing
                with applied 3D modeling tech into automotive vehicles
                in the future, such as the manipulation of the unity
                modules with the self-designed programs of C++.
                <br><br>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Personal Opinions</h4>
            <p>
                I am currently living in the States for my long-term graduate
                study and related research demands. Compared with my previous
                academic life in the UK, in I prefer the vibes in the States,
                and here are several reasons:<br><br>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Compared with British universities, fewer interference conditions
                    exist in the college environment of the States. Most of the US
                    universities and colleges are built in the outskirts instead of
                    downtown areas, so students and faculties have fewer chances to
                    be influenced by surrounding entertainment, such as pubs, shopping
                    malls, etc.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    US schools' funding by far overweighs British schools'.  What I feel
                    shamed for British universities is that faculties from many British
                    universities would go on strike within one month each year, and most
                    of the students have few opportunities to receive different forms of
                    financial aid from British universities. However, I can go to the free
                    shop of my US uni and choose as many goods as I want, and I do not have
                    to pay them, just because I am a student. Moreover, students are likely
                    to receive academic promotions, such as graduate student instructors
                    and research assistants. They can waiver some of the tuition fees and
                    gain additional salaries.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Compared with the US, I feel like everything in the UK is more like
                porcelain, delicate but fragile, and not solid. The only reason I am
                grateful to my UK academic life is that it offers a platform and
                opportunities to help me go to the USA.
            </p>
