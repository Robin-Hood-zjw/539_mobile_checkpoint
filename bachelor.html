            <h4>Self-Introduction</h4>
            <p>
                I studied Architecture and Electrical and Mechanical Engineering
                during my bachelor's degree at <a href="uoe.html">
                the University of Edinburgh</a>.
                It is fortunate for me to embrace different disciplines of Science,
                Engineering, Arts, and Design, and I enjoy the experience of crossing
                diverse colleges since they were my touch the diversity and welcome
                diverse ideas.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Interesting Experience</h4>
            <p>Joining the community of the University of Edinburgh is one of the happiest
                decisions that I have ever made. Although I mentioned some disappointing
                aspects of British university education, I acknowledge that Edinburgh Uni
                brings me to a high platform, so I have more possibilities and opportunities
                to pursue my targets, such as going to the States. I enjoyed the years spent
                in this community and my commitment there, and some memo are recorded in my
                life because of my experience in Edinburgh:
            </p>
